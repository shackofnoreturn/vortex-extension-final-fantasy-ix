Where should the mods be installed?: (multiple ways to install mods?)
How are mod archives usually structured? (and how consistently?)

Example:
 Most mods for this game are presented as .pak files which are placed in the folder “BloodstainedRotN/Content/Paks/~mods” or “BloodstainedRotN/Content/Paks/~mod”. The “~mods” option is the community standard.

 The majority of mods have the .pak files on the root level of the mod archive, however, some mod archives contain variants or are structured in different ways.
